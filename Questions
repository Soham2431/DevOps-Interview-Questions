Q1. There is an application receiving millions of requests.
My system capacity is to handle 50,000 requests per second, but the incoming traffic is 1,000,000 requests per second.
How can this be handled?

Q2. There is an application running with two pods.
Each pod has a capacity to handle 50,000 requests, but one pod is receiving 70,000 requests and is crashing.
How can we fix this and ensure traffic is distributed to the other pod?

Q3. If a version of an object is deleted from an S3 bucket and versioning is enabled, how can you recover it?

Q4. If all versions of an object (Terraform state file) are deleted from an S3 bucket, how can you recover the state file?

Q5. Initially, if the Terraform state file is stored locally, how do you create an S3 bucket for remote backend storage?

Q6. How do you maintain the Terraform state file in a team environment?

Q7. How do you upload a file from an EC2 instance to an S3 bucket?

Q8. There are Node A and Node B, both tainted.
Pod 1 has toleration A
Pod 2 has toleration B
There is another node that is not tainted
One pod does not have any toleration
Which Kubernetes component prevents the pod without toleration from running on the tainted node?

Q9.Write a Python program to reverse a string without using any built-in functions.

jenkins there are pipelines 
if dev commits the code dev then dev pipeline needs to trigger 
if dev commits the code to qa then QA pipeline needs to trigger please write the logic for it in jenkins?

is it possible to trgger qa pipelinedirectly if they created bugs to fix and now directly wants to run qa pipeline only ?
how you take backup of jenkins ? which folder do you use to take backup ?
if i want use that in one ec2 jenkins backup folder in another ec2 instance where jenkins is there how can do that ?

Let's say. I nave deployed API in Kubernetes. And it is running database. Okay. so, What are all the components that are needed? F actively. Serve the request that is coming from outside lines
The API is running. The API is running in a Kubernetes cluster in a place.
Okay, so I am a client. I'm coming to you. I need To access that APA. Okay. So, you need to configure. Multiple things. For that. So that I will be able to access it because they is currently running in the AWS. That is a private. Your private VPC. I am a public user, I need to access it. So what are all the
So what are all the components that are needed that you need to configure? So that I will be A able to access your API.
A load balancer. You have created in that is AWS component. In Kubernetes You have created the increase of created the service
okay, so now you have created a service load balancer service When you create a Load Balancer service. So what will be created in the AWS side? There will be a lot.
Okay. Now let's say you have created a, what kind of Like in Route, 53 water. All the things, you will provide for that.
Okay. So, in DNS. so, In a Linux machine. Let's say you have a instance created. And you need that instance to use a particular DNS. So, how you will configure that?
yeah, there is a DNS server, let's say, you have you are hosting a DNS and you have a different DNS server and you have you need your PC to instance, to use your DNS server. How you will be able to achieve that? 
Okay, you have DNS server. You have created a DNS server. Okay, and you have created a easy to instance. That is a Linux instance: 80 you want your Linux instance to use the DNS server that you have created? For the name resolution. So, how you will achieve that?
Okay. Let's say you need to find a particular file. In a directory. How do you do that? What is the command?
So, how you will be able to filter out a single line? Using our command
If you put dollar one, Will it print? First. Line, or first column.
which is commnd to give as a single line out put from file
there are two files which contains 150 lines in one file and other file contain 200 lines how will find out that 50 different lines which not in file 1
