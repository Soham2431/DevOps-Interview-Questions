USER MANAGEMENT

LDAPS == for HTTPS secure way access by using certificate manager

then we have to create files like 
base.ldif == what action we have to create like users groups 
users.ldif == user name ans pass
groups.ldif == groups 

then go to jenkins manage jenkins security - select LDAPS - add ip of ldaps or jenins server - add groups - appy proper permission like read view build logs view

✅ Jenkins User Management using LDAP / LDAPS (Correct Explanation)
🔹 What is LDAPS?

LDAP over SSL/TLS
Secure authentication using certificates
Uses port 636
Preferred over plain LDAP (389)

❌ Important correction (VERY IMPORTANT)

👉 You do NOT create base.ldif, users.ldif, groups.ldif on Jenkins

Those LDIF files are created on the LDAP server, NOT Jenkins.
They are used to:
Create users
Create groups
Define relationships (user ↔ group)

Examples:

users.ldif → user entries
groups.ldif → group entries
base.ldif → base DN structure

✔️ This is LDAP admin work, not Jenkins work.

🟢 Correct Jenkins-side configuration steps
1️⃣ Configure LDAP / LDAPS in Jenkins

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Security → Configure Global Security

Under Security Realm:

Select LDAP
Enable Use SSL (LDAPS)

2️⃣ Provide LDAP details

You configure:

LDAP server IP / hostname
Port: 636
Root DN
dc=example,dc=com


User search base:
ou=users
Group search base:
ou=groups

LDAP bind DN (service account)

LDAP bind password
Upload / trust LDAP SSL certificate (via JVM keystore)

3️⃣ Test LDAP connection

✔️ Jenkins provides Test LDAP Settings
Always mention this in interviews.

4️⃣ Configure Authorization (Permissions)

Go to Authorization section:
Common options:
Matrix-based security
Role-based authorization strategy (recommended)

5️⃣ Assign permissions to LDAP users/groups

Example permissions:
Overall → Read
Job → Build
Job → Read
Job → View
Job → Workspace
View → Read
Logs → View

👉 Permissions are mapped to LDAP groups, not individual users (best practice).

🟢 Interview-ready corrected answer (Short & Perfect)

“Jenkins user management is done using LDAP or LDAPS. User and group creation is handled on the LDAP server using LDIF files. In Jenkins, we configure LDAP under Global Security, enable LDAPS for secure 
authentication, provide LDAP server details, and then use matrix or role-based authorization to assign permissions to LDAP groups.
